    This project contains optional tests that you can just uncomment if you want an extra challenge. 
    Your task will be to extend the search_gists function to accept the following optional parameters:

        created_at__gt
        created_at__gte
        created_at__lt
        created_at__lte
        updated_at__gt
        updated_at__gte
        updated_at__lt
        updated_at__lte

    These parameters will be operating against the created_at and updated_at fields using 
    the corresponding comparison: gt means greater than, gte greater than or equal to, 
    lt less than, lte less than or equal to.

    That is, created_at__gt=datetime(2018, 1, 1) are all the Gists that were created 
    AFTER January 1st 2018. If we use created_at__gt, thatâ€™d also include the corresponding day.
